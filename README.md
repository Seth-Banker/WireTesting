When you release levels for the NY session you should make it the same date of the NY session.

If you can't release levels for some reason just don't update the date.

If for some reason you update the levels but can't make a reddit post or a youtube video just put "none" for the links and it will not show the button for that link.

newsletter link will show, regardless if data is expired.
